# Resources on Machine Learning for Phylogenetics
[Phylogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics) is really cool. So is [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).
These notes try to collect material on Machine Learning applications to phylogenetic problems. 

If you need to brush off on your knowledge of Statistical Phylogenetics, [these](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Statistical_Phylogenetics_resources) notes might be a good starting point.
