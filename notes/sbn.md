# Computing tree probabilities from a set of trees and variational inference

  - Introduced the idea of a conditional clade probability, which assumed some independence between clades and scored trees based on the product of their CCDs.
These were then used to guide MCMC proposals.

  - Introduced the idea of  (approximate) **conditional independence of separated subtrees** (CISS) hypothesis.
The resulting conditional clade distributions (CCD) forgo computing the normalisation and thus are easier to compute.

  - noticed that the CCD  underestimated the posterior for sub-peaks and overestimated the posterior between peaks.

  - Introduced the idea of subsplit Bayesian networks (SBN), which extend the CCD with a richer representation of the distribution on trees.
