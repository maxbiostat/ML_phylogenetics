# Computing tree probabilities from a set of trees and variational inference

- HÃ¶hna, S., & Drummond, A. J. (2012). [Guided tree topology proposals for Bayesian phylogenetic inference](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syr074). Systematic Biology, 61(1), 1-11.
  - Introduced the idea of a conditional clade probability, which assumed some independence between clades and scored trees based on the product of their CCDs.
These were then used to guide MCMC proposals.

  - Introduced the idea of  (approximate) **conditional independence of separated subtrees** (CISS) hypothesis.
The resulting conditional clade distributions (CCD) forgo computing the normalisation and thus are easier to compute.

  - noticed that the CCD  underestimated the posterior for sub-peaks and overestimated the posterior between peaks.

  - Introduced the idea of subsplit Bayesian networks (SBN), which extend the CCD with a richer representation of the distribution on trees.

## Software

[bito](https://github.com/phylovi/bito) (Bayesian Inference of Trees via Optimization) is a Python/TensorFlow/PyTorch library that implements many of the SBN-related methods.
